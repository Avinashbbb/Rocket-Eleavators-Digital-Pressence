<h3 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">Exploring Your Commercial Elevator Options</h3>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size ll-at-line-height">Whether you operate a multi-level mega-mall or an office building, you cannot do so without a commercial wheelchair lift or elevator. Commercial enterprises of all kinds have turned to Nationwide Lifts for a wide selection of products, from <a href="https://www.elevators.com/commercial-elevators/passenger/" class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">passenger elevators</a> to <a href="https://www.elevators.com/commercial-elevators/wheelchair-lifts/" class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">wheelchair lifts</a>, <a href="https://www.elevators.com/commercial-elevators/freight-in-ground-hydraulic/" class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">freight elevators</a>, and <a href="https://www.elevators.com/commercial-elevators/dumbwaiters/" class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">dumbwaiters</a>. The commercial elevators and lifts we have for sale are trusted designs that are guaranteed to work to their specifications, and among the commercial elevators for sale at Nationwide Lifts, we have many <a href="https://www.elevators.com/specs/commercial-specs-bims-drawings/" class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">different sizes, styles, and designs</a> suitable for a number of uses.</p>

<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size ll-at-line-height">For instance, our passenger elevators are ideal for nearly any application, making it possible to transport people and bulky objects from one floor to the next. And our <a href="https://www.elevators.com/commercial-elevators/lula-limited-use-limited-application/" class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">LULA (limited-use/limited-application) elevators</a> are ideal for adding accessibility to churches, small offices, or other spaces up to three levels tall. These elevators are a bit smaller than a typical passenger elevator, making them easy to install in virtually any building. But which type of commercial lift is right for you? The answer will depend on factors including the amount of people or freight you need to lift and the amount of space you have.</p>


<hr id="elevator-sizes" class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">

<h3 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">Commercial Elevator Sizes</h3>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">Within a business setting, commercial elevators can be used to lift objects and groups of all sizes. A commercial elevator can range in size from a dumbwaiter to a freight elevator. Businesses that need to transport small objects from floor to floor, like books and dishes, can make great use of a dumbwaiter. Other businesses will need to move large, heavy loads of cargo brought in with a forklift or other heavy machinery, and a freight elevator is built to withstand this sort of use.</p>

<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">The type of elevator installed depends on your budget, requirements, and space, which is why Nationwide Lifts has an extensive selection of commercial elevators to meet every need. When exploring available elevators, one of the first details to consider is the typical elevator shaft dimensions. Our representatives can help customers to determine the commercial elevator dimensions that would be best for their business.</p>

<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">Nationwide Lifts offers many commercial elevators with varying specifications to fit different needs and applications.</p>

 	<li class="ll-at-font ll-at-size ll-at-line-height"><strong class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">Size Requirements for Commercial Elevators:</strong> At the upper landing, the ceiling height requirement is 106 inches for remodeling installations and 134 inches for new construction installation. These elevators can provide access to as many as three different levels, and they can travel up to 25 feet.

Several different vertical wheelchair lifts have a standard cab size of 36 inches by 54 inches. Customizable sizing is also available for up to 18 square feet. An inclined wheelchair lift provides accessibility on a staircase using a platform that moves up and down the steps. The dimensions of the platform are 30 inches by 49 inches, and customization is also available for larger sizes.</li>

<h3 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">Accessibility Considerations</h3>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size ll-at-line-height">Commercial elevators offer convenience to their users, but they can also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/07/24/423230927/-a-gift-to-the-non-disabled-at-25-the-ada-improves-access-for-all" class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">provide accessibility</a> for customers, a crucial concern for businesses. Our elevators can meet ADA standards, allowing people of all abilities to use the elevator and access all parts of your building. "ADA" stands for the Americans With Disabilities Act, which defines guidelines for making buildings and elevators accessible for those with disabilities. Accessible elevators are important to your business because they create an inclusive culture and guarantee that no patrons are turned away due to limited access. They can also help you avoid fines stemming from a failure to meet ADA standards.</p>

<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">For a commercial elevator, the minimum elevator dimensions to meet ADA specifications depend on the placement of the door. If the door is centered, the elevator car should be 51 inches deep and 80 inches wide; for elevators with a door placed to the side, the minimum width is 68 inches.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">How Much Space Is Needed for an Elevator?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">A standard elevator will need about 5 to 7 feet of space lengthwise and widthwise for the cab, and the shaft will need at least 4 feet of pit depth.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">What Is the Shaft of an Elevator?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">The shaft is the passage that the elevator travels through. It's a space that the passenger doesn't have access to in normal circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">What Is the Size of an Elevator Shaft?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">This completely depends on the dimensions of the elevator in question. In most cases, the elevator shaft must have minimum of 4 feet of pit space at the bottom, but the length and width will typically be slightly larger than the size of the elevator's cab.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">How Many People Can Fit in a Lift or Elevator?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">The number of people who can fit into an elevator depends on the setup and dimensions of the elevator, but a good indication is to look at the listed capacity. In most cases, an elevator can hold more weight than the number of people who can physically fit in an elevator, so it should be easy to stay at the proper capacity.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">How Wide Is a Typical Elevator Door?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">ADA guidelines, which determine standard elevator dimensions to ensure accessibility for disabled people, dictate that elevator door dimensions should be at least 36 inches wide, so wheelchairs can comfortably pass through.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">How Tall Are a Standard Elevator and Elevator Door?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">A standard elevator door is between 6 and 8 feet tall, with the overall elevator height falling somewhere in that range.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">How Do I Calculate My Lift Size?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">The size of your lift will depend on ADA guidelines, how much space you have, and how many people you need to accommodate. Keep in mind that commercial elevator cabs should typically be wider compared to a residential elevator to ensure that groups of people have enough space to enter and exit the car safely. Also, be sure to follow local laws: Each state has its own unique elevator codes and regulations to be followed, which may include a required standard elevator size.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">How Much Does a Four-Person Lift Cost?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">The cost to install a commercial that fits four people depends in part on how many floors the industrial elevator needs to travel between. Contact us for a free price estimate for your unique situation.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">What Are Freight Elevators?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">A freight elevator is designed for the transportation of cargo rather than people. These lifts can usually take on heavier loads.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">What Is the Size of a Freight Elevator?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">Freight elevator dimensions and capacity will vary depending on your needs. The smallest freight lifts measure less than 6 feet by 8 feet inside and can hold 4,000 pounds; the largest measure 12 feet by around 17.5 feet inside and can lift up to 15,000 pounds.</p>
<h4 class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">How Much Weight Can a Freight Elevator Hold?</h4>
<p class="ll-at-font ll-at-size">A freight elevator can hold from 4,000 to 15,000 pounds.</p>
